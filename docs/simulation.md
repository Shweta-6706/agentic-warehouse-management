WHAT-IF STIMULATION ENGINE:

Purpose
Enable scenario-based planning without altering original data.
Supported Simulations
Demand Increase

Demand_t = Demand_t × (1 + % Increase)

Lead Time Delay
Lead Time = Original Lead Time + Delay
Demand Spike
Applies temporary shock multiplier to demand series.

Use Cases:-
Seasonal demand surge
Supplier disruption
Logistics delays
Emergency planning

The system recalculates optimization metrics dynamically after simulation.
