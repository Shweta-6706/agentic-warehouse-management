2.2 Component Overview
  
A. Data Layer
Handles ingestion of compressed product datasets.

Responsibilities:
* Decompress dataset
* Validate schema
* Handle missing values
* Convert demand history into time-series format

B. Forecasting Module
Generates future demand predictions.
Currently implemented: Moving Average Forecasting

Future support:
* ARIMA
* LSTM
* Prophet

C. Optimization Engine
Implements classical inventory models.
  
Reorder Point (ROP)
ROP = (Average Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}

Where:
* D = Annual demand
* S = Ordering cost
* H = Holding cost

D. Agent Decision Layer
The core intelligence module.

The agent:
1. Evaluates forecasted demand
2. Compares with current stock
3. Calculates depletion time
4. Classifies risk level
5. Generates reorder recommendations
6. Produces human-readable explanation

3. Data Design
3.1 Dataset Schema

| Field              | Type        | Description                |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| product_id         | string      | Unique identifier          |
| current_stock      | int         | Available inventory        |
| historical_demand  | list/series | Past demand values         |
| lead_time          | int         | Replenishment delay (days) |
| ordering_cost      | float       | Cost per order             |
| holding_cost       | float       | Storage cost per unit      |
| warehouse_capacity | int         | Maximum stock capacity     |

3.2 Data Processing Flow
1. Load compressed file (.zip / .gz)
2. Extract CSV
3. Parse into Pandas DataFrame
4. Validate data types
5. Normalize demand values
6. Compute average demand

4. Forecasting Module
4.1 Moving Average Forecast

Formula:
Forecast_t = \frac{D_{t-1} + D_{t-2} + ... + D_{t-n}}{n}

Advantages:
* Simple
* Fast
* Stable for steady demand

Limitations:
* Poor at capturing seasonality
* Sensitive to trend shifts

4.2 Forecast Output

The system generates:
* Predicted demand
* Demand growth percentage
* Volatility metric

️5 Optimization Engine

5.1 Reorder Logic
If: Current Stock ≤ Reorder Point
Then:
* Trigger reorder recommendation

5.2 EOQ Calculation

EOQ minimizes:
* Ordering cost
* Holding cost
  
Trade-off optimization ensures cost efficiency.

5.3 Safety Stock
Safety Stock can be calculated using:
Safety Stock = Z × σ × \sqrt{Lead Time}

Where:

* Z = Service level factor
* σ = Demand standard deviation

6.2 Risk Classification

| Condition         | Risk Level  |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Stock > 1.5 × ROP | Safe        |
| Stock ≈ ROP       | Warning     |
| Stock < ROP       | Critical    |

6.3 Recommendation Output

The agent provides:
* Suggested reorder quantity
* Urgency level
* Expected stockout date
* Explanation summary

Example:
> Product P102 is expected to experience a 15% increase in demand. Current stock will last 5 days. Reorder 420 units within 2 days. Risk Level: Critical.
