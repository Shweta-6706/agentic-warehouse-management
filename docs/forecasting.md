Demand Forecasting Module

Objective:
Estimate future demand using statistical methods suitable for short-term operational planning.
Moving Average Forecast

The moving average smooths historical demand:
Forecast = (Sum of last N periods) / N

Advantages:
Simple
Fast
Robust for stable demand patterns
Demand Volatility

Volatility is measured using standard deviation:
σ = √(Σ(x - μ)² / N)

Used for:
Safety stock calculation
Risk scoring
Forecast confidence

Growth Rate Detection
Growth Rate = (Last Period - First Period) / First Period

Used to:
Detect increasing demand
Adjust priority scoring
Identify emerging risk

Why Deterministic Models?
For operational inventory management:
Interpretability is critical
Stability is preferred over black-box ML
Fast computation is required
