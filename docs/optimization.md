Inventory Optimization Engine

Objective:
Determine optimal replenishment strategy using classical inventory theory.
Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Volatility × √Lead Time

Protects against:
Demand uncertainty
Lead time variability
Reorder Point (ROP)

ROP = (Average Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

If current stock < ROP → reorder required

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

EOQ = √(2DS / H)

Where:

D = Annual demand
S = Ordering cost
H = Holding cost

EOQ minimizes total cost:
Total Cost = Ordering Cost + Holding Cost

Depletion Days
Depletion Days = Current Stock / Average Daily Demand

Used to:
Estimate urgency
Rank products by risk
